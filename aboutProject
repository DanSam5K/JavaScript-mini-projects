This project is intended to showcase how Javascript can be used to solve simple task in every day to day sphere of life when mastered and call upon to do so.

#project task and what file is solving each

1. Kelvin Weather (projectask1.js)
Deep in his mountain-side meteorology lab, the mad scientist Kelvin has mastered weather prediction.

Recently, Kelvin began publishing his weather forecasts on his website. However there’s a problem: All of his forecasts describe the temperature in Kelvin.

With my knowledge of JavaScript, i was able assist this scientist convert Kelvin to Celsius, then to Fahrenheit and also to Newton.

2. Dog Years (projectask2.js)
Dogs mature at a faster rate than human beings. We often say a dog’s age can be calculated in “dog years” to account for their growth compared to a human of the same age. In some ways we could say, time moves quickly for dogs — 8 years in a human’s life equates to 45 years in a dog’s life. How old would you be if you were a dog?

Here’s how you convert your age from “human years” to “dog years”:

The first two years of a dog’s life count as 10.5 dog years each.
Each year following equates to 4 dog years.

3.Magic Eight Ball (projectask3.js)
Control flow! It’s so powerful, that it can be used to tell someone’s fortune.

In this project we will build the Magic Eight Ball using control flow in JavaScript.

The user will be able to input a question, then our program will output a random fortune.

4.Race Day (projectask4.js)
My local school annual race is just around the corner! This year 2020, they have a lot of participants. I have been hired to write a program that will register runners for the race and give them instructions on race day.
Here’s how our registration works. There are adult runners (over 18 years of age) and youth runners (under 18 years of age). They can register early or late. Runners are assigned a race number and start time based on their age and registration.

Race number:

Early adults receive a race number at or above 1000.
All others receive a number below 1000.
Start time:

Adult registrants run at 9:30 am or 11:00 am.
Early adults run at 9:30 am.
Late adults run at 11:00 am.
Youth registrants run at 12:30 pm (regardless of registration).
