1. Kelvin Weather (projectask1.js)
Deep in his mountain-side meteorology lab, the mad scientist Kelvin has mastered weather prediction.

Recently, Kelvin began publishing his weather forecasts on his website. However there’s a problem: All of his forecasts describe the temperature in Kelvin.

The first two years of a dog’s life count as 10.5 dog years each.
Each year following equates to 4 dog years.
