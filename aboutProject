#project task and what file is solving each

1. Kelvin Weather (projectask1.js)
Deep in his mountain-side meteorology lab, the mad scientist Kelvin has mastered weather prediction.

Recently, Kelvin began publishing his weather forecasts on his website. However there’s a problem: All of his forecasts describe the temperature in Kelvin.

With my knowledge of JavaScript, i was able assist this scientist convert Kelvin to Celsius, then to Fahrenheit and also to Newton.

2. Dog Years (projectask2.js)
Dogs mature at a faster rate than human beings. We often say a dog’s age can be calculated in “dog years” to account for their growth compared to a human of the same age. In some ways we could say, time moves quickly for dogs — 8 years in a human’s life equates to 45 years in a dog’s life. How old would you be if you were a dog?

Here’s how you convert your age from “human years” to “dog years”:

The first two years of a dog’s life count as 10.5 dog years each.
Each year following equates to 4 dog years.

3.Magic Eight Ball (projectask3)
Control flow! It’s so powerful, that it can be used to tell someone’s fortune.

In this project we will build the Magic Eight Ball using control flow in JavaScript.

The user will be able to input a question, then our program will output a random fortune.
